# Coding Challenge #
Please organize, design, test, document and deploy your code as if it were going into production, then send us a link to the hosted repository (e.g. Github, Bitbucket...).

## Functional Specs - Product App ##
Create a single page web app which list all the products (mobile phones) & allows to sort by category (brand wise). 

Data Set: Use any openly available data. 

## Technical spec ##
The architecture will be split between a back-end and a web front-end, for instance providing a JSON in/out RESTful API. 

## Choose one of the following technical tracks that best suits your skillset: ##

1. Full-stack: include both front-end and back-end.
2. Back-end track: include a minimal front-end (e.g. a static view or API docs). Write, document and test your API as if it will be used by other services.
3. Front-end track: include a minimal back-end, or use the data service directly. Focus on making the interface as polished as possible.

## Back-end ##
We believe there is no one-size-fits-all technology. Good engineering is about using the right tool for the right job, and constantly learning about them. Therefore, feel free to mention in your README how much experience you have with the technical stack you choose, we will take note of that when reviewing your challenge.

Here are some technologies we are more familiar with:

1. Python
2. JavaScript
3. Go
4. Java


## Front-end ##
The front-end should ideally be a single page app . You may take this opportunity to demonstrate your React knowledge.

The UX/UI is totally up to you. If you like, get creative and add additional features a user might find useful!

## Host it! (optinal) ##
When youâ€™re done, host it somewhere (e.g. on Amazon EC2, Heroku, Google AppEngine, etc.)
